    You are given a string s of even length consisting of digits from 0 to 9, and two integers a and b.

    You can perform two operations any number of times and in any order:
        1. Add a to all digits at odd indices (0-indexed). If a digit exceeds 9, it wraps around (mod 10).
        2. Rotate the string to the right by b positions.

    Your task is to return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain after any sequence of operations.

    Example 1:
        Input: s = "5525", a = 9, b = 2
        Output: "2050"

    Example 2:
        Input: s = "74", a = 5, b = 1
        Output: "24"

    Example 3:
        Input: s = "0011", a = 4, b = 2
        Output: "0011"

        """
        Approach:
        1. We can perform two reversible operations: add on odd indices and rotate.
        2. Since the number of possible strings is finite (each digit can take 10 values and string length â‰¤ 100),
           we can use BFS (or DFS) to explore all possible transformations.
        3. We track visited strings to avoid cycles.
        4. For each state:
            - Generate string after applying the "add" operation.
            - Generate string after applying the "rotate" operation.
            - Continue exploring until all reachable strings are visited.
        5. Return the lexicographically smallest string encountered.
