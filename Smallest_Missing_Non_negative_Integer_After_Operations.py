    You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer value.

    In one operation, you can add or subtract `value` from any element of nums.

    The MEX (minimum excluded value) of an array is the smallest missing
    non-negative integer in it.

    Your task is to find the **maximum possible MEX** after performing any number
    of add/subtract operations on the elements of `nums`.

    Example:
        Input: nums = [1, -10, 7, 13, 6, 8], value = 5
        Output: 4

    Approach:
    -----------
    - Any number x can be transformed into any number `x + k*value` (for integer k).
    - So effectively, each numberâ€™s possible values are determined by its remainder
      modulo `value`.
    - Count how many numbers fall into each remainder class (`0..value-1`).
    - Then, to construct the smallest non-negative integers in order, we can
      "consume" one number from each remainder bucket in a cyclic manner.
    - As soon as a bucket becomes empty for the required remainder, that is our MEX.

        Finds the maximum achievable MEX after applying +value or -value operations.

        Steps:
        1. Compute frequency of each remainder (mod value).
        2. Iterate i from 0 upward:
            - For each i, check the remainder i % value.
            - Decrease its count by 1.
            - If any remainder count goes below zero, that `i` is the maximum MEX.
