    You are given two integers num1 and num2.

    In one operation, you can choose an integer i in [0, 60] and subtract (2^i + num2) from num1.

    Task:
    - Find the minimum number of operations required to make num1 = 0.
    - If it's impossible, return -1.

    Approach:
    - After k operations:
        num1 - k * num2 must equal the sum of k powers of two.
    - Let diff = num1 - k * num2.
    - Conditions for feasibility:
        1. diff >= k   (we need at least k ones in binary to represent diff)
        2. popcount(diff) <= k   (binary representation must fit within k terms)
    - Loop k from 1 to 60, check feasibility.
    - Return the first valid k, else -1.

    Time Complexity: O(60) â‰ˆ O(1)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
